## Challenge 🚀💫
Inspired by [Inktober](https://inktober.com/rules). 42CSSTober is a challenge created by @larcrist for the 42 Ecole Community[Unnoficial event] to improve your coding skills by creating daily mini-illustrations primarily using HTML5 and CSS3. <br><br>
The challenge involves creating a mini-illustration each day based on the designated theme for that day and your interpretation of it over the course of 31 days in October, +11 Bonus Days, for a total of 42 illustrations crafted with CSS.

## List

### 📝 Rules 
- Don't be a jerk. Be respectful. Don't draw offensive things!
- Use only CSS, HTML, and maybe JS to create your artwork; no external files like SVG, PNG, or JPG are allowed. Do everything manually, without external imports or shortcuts.
- Ensure your art is responsive.
- Keep your project organized with a GitHub repository, with a cool readme, and host the challenges using GitHub Pages to add in the showcase part 👇.
- Share your results on social media with #42CSSTober hashtag.
- 31 + 11 = 42: As a bonus, we've added an additional +11 challenges to the list. These challenges should be developed using only one `<div>` (or whatever element you want) along with its `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements.
- Have fun! There's no need to follow a strict schedule; you can create daily, adopt an alternate creation rhythm (every other day), or even do a "5K run" or create once a week. The key is to maintain consistency. The goal of 42CSSTober is to grow, improve, and develop positive habits while gaining a deeper understanding of CSS properties.

❗️ | A basic understanding of HTML and CSS syntax is recommended, but if you don't have it, it's a good opportunity to learn!

## 📌 Showcase
This is an initiative created for the community with the intention of helping you learn HTML and CSS skills and problem-solving through daily coding challenges. <br> A web page has been created for you to showcase your solutions to the community.  <br> Read how to contribute to the showcase in [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Tips and Tricks 😜
#### Golden Tip! ✨
- By Lula from 42São Paulo, avoid attempting to complete all the steps at once. Use Baby Steps! 👶🏾🍼

#### Silver Tip!
- Create a simple sketch of the drawing you intend to create; this will provide you with a better understanding of which CSS properties need to be applied in the project.
- Maintain organization in your files.
- If you reference external illustrations, be sure to credit the artist in your project's Readme.
