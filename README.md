## Challenge üöÄüí´
Inspired by [Inktober](https://inktober.com/rules), 42CSSTober is a challenge created by 42 cadets for the 42 Ecole Community to improve your coding skills by creating daily mini-illustrations primarily using HTML5 and CSS3. <br> <br> The challenge involves creating a mini-illustration each day based on the designated theme for that day and your interpretation of it over the course of 31 days in October, + 11 Bonus Days, for a total of 42 illustrations crafted with CSS.

## Rules
- Be respectful.
- Use only CSS, HTML and maybe JS to create your artwork; no external files like SVG, PNG, or JPG are allowed. Do everything manually, without external imports or shortcuts.
- Ensure your art is responsive.
- Keep your project organized with a GitHub repository, w/ a cool readme, and host the challenges using GitHub Pages.
- Share your results on social media with #42CSSTober hashtag.
- Have fun! There's no need to follow a strict schedule; you can create daily, adopt an alternate creation rhythm (every other day), or even do a "5K run" or create once a week. <br> The key is to maintain consistency. The goal of 42CSSTober is to grow, improve, and develop positive habits while gaining a deeper understanding of CSS properties.

‚ùóÔ∏è | A basic understanding of HTML and CSS syntax is recommended, but if you don't have it, it's a good opportunity to learn!

## Tips and Tricks üòú
#### Golden Tip! ‚ú®
- As per Bocal, Lula from 42S√£o Paulo, avoid attempting to complete all the steps at once. Use Baby Steps! üë∂üèæüçº

#### Silver Tip!
- Create a simple sketch of the drawing you intend to create; this will provide you with a better understanding of which CSS properties need to be applied in the project.
- Maintain organization in your files.
